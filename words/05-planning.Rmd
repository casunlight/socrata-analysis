I didn't find a list of manually tagged dataset topics,
but it did occur to me that the attribution field is
something like a topic. I decided to predict whether a
dataset was released by a planning department.

attr <- sort(table(socrata$attribution), decreasing = T)
attr[grepl('lanning', names(attr)) & attr > 1]

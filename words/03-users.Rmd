(Introduction here)

## The user data
I'm still using the same 80,000 JSON files that I downloaded last month.
Each of these metadata files describes a Socrata view. Among their many
fields are two fields related to the people who interacted with that view.
These fields are the `owner` and  `tableAuthor` fields. These fields are
both hashes/dictionaries/arrays with user information. For example, here's
mine.

    {
        "id" : "x73b-9d8f",
        "displayName" : "Thomas Levine",
        "emailUnsubscribed" : false,
        "privacyControl" : "login",
        "profileLastModified" : 1371141485,
        "screenName" : "Thomas Levine"
    }

### `owner`
The `owner` field is quite straightforward; it's simply the person who
created the view, be it a dataset, chart, map or whatever.

### `tableAuthor`
The `tableAuthor` field is the person who uploaded the dataset associated
with the view. For datasets, this is the same as the owner, but for charts,
maps and filtered views, it might be different; one person may have uploaded
the data, and another person might have made the chart. "view", "dataset",
"map", "chart", "filtered view" and "table" all have rather special meanings
inside Socrata, so you should read my [post on that](/!/socrata-genealogies)
if the previous sentence didn't make sense.

## Extracting the user data
I already had a system for storing all of the Socrata metadata, so I just needed to write a
[sloppy function](https://github.com/tlevine/socrata-analysis/blob/e3d12254e928f986f1a83ed2099577e289048b94/numbers/run.py#L207)
to query it. This resulted in an SQLite3 database, which I converted to a
[CSV file](https://raw.github.com/tlevine/socrata-analysis/e3d12254e928f986f1a83ed2099577e289048b94/users.csv)
and read into R.

<!--
In case a view was federated, only one copy is counted, so this doesn't
have the duplication issues that some people were concerned about.
-->

Rather than remembering which tables and datasets everyone owned, that function
just remembers how many. Maybe I'll do something with the links later.

## Analysis
The table schema looks like this.

```{r schema}
str(users)
```

### Missing data
Not everyone had all of the fields.

```{r missingness}
a <- t(as.data.frame(lapply(users, function(variable){ sum(!is.na(variable)) } )))
missingness <- data.frame(
  variable = rownames(a),
  present.value = a[,1]
)
missingness <- missingness[order(missingness$present.value, decreasing = T),]
barplot(
  (missingness$present.value),
  names.arg = missingness$variable,
  border = NA, col = 'grey', axes = F, horiz = T, las = 1,
  xlim = c(0, 12000),
  main = 'How complete is the user profile metadata?',
  xlab = 'Number of users with the field',
  ylab = 'Field'
)
axis(1, at = seq(0, 12000, 2000))
abline(v = nrow(users), col = 2, lty = 2)
text(x = nrow(users), y = 15, labels = paste(nrow(users), 'total users'), col = 2, pos = 2)
text(x = 2500, y = 14, labels = 'Missing data', col = 2)
text(x = 10000, y = 3, labels = 'Complete data', col = 2)
```

### How many views do people have?

```{r n.views}
plot.count(users$n_views, 'views', col = (users$id == 'e8ug-wzay') + 1)
text(x = 0.2, y = 1.2, labels = 'Most users\nhave one view', pos = 4, col = 2)
text(x = 3.5, y = 1.5, labels = 'Data.gov Program\nManagement Office', col = 2)
```

Most users (``sum(users$n_views == 1)`` to be exact) have exactly one view.
Actually, there are probably even more with no views, but I don't have the
data on them.

That one way off to the side is the Data.gov Program Management Office,
with ``users['e8ug-wzay','n_views']``. 

Let's try that again, but I'm going to color the plot by whether the user's role
is "administrator" or "publisher". (Other possibilities are "designer", "editor",
"publisher", "viewer" and a missing value.)

```{r n.views.byrole}
plot.count(users$n_views, 'views', col = 1 + (!is.na(users$roleName) & (users$roleName == 'publisher' | users$roleName == 'administrator')))
```

It looks like publishers and administrators (red) make more views. Big surprise.

### How many tables?

Let's make that same plot but for the number of tables. (A table is a raw
uploaded dataset, before any view filtering. A table can have many views,
and a view has only one table.)

```{r n.tables}
plot.count(users$n_tables, 'tables', col = 1 + (!is.na(users$roleName) & (users$roleName == 'publisher' | users$roleName == 'administrator')))
text(x = 0.2, y = 1.2, labels = 'Most users\nhave one table', pos = 4, col = 2)
text(x = 3.5, y = 1.5, labels = 'Data.gov Program\nManagement Office', col = 2)
```

That point off to the right is again the Data.gov Program Management Office.o

### How many derived views?
When you upload a tabular data file to Socrata, Socrata creates a "table" and
a "dataset" view on that table. When you filter a view inside Socrata, Socrata
creates a new view but no new table. Thus, the difference between number of
tables and number of views tells us how many derived views people have made.
I think.

```{r n.derived}
plot.count(users$n_views - users$n_tables, 'derived views', col = 1 + ((!is.na(users$roleName) & (users$roleName == 'publisher' | users$roleName == 'administrator'))))
```

It also turns out that 65 users have more tables than views. This appears to be
mostly publishers. Maybe this is something about how the import API works that I
don't understand.

## Aside from data publishers and Socrata employees, who uses Socrata a lot?

### More tables than views
Here are people with tables but no views. (As I mentioned earlier, I didn't
realize that this was possible!) I figure that these people are probably
data publishers.

```{r data.publishers.2}
subset(users, n_tables > n_views)[c('displayName', 'roleName', 'flags', 'n_tables', 'n_views')]
```

I looked up a few of them with a search engine, and they mostly
[seem](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jkray)
[to](http://www.imaginaryrobots.net/resumes/Jesse_van_Herk_resume.pdf)
[be](http://www.linkedin.com/in/debraagagne)
[government](http://www.whitehouse.gov/champions/technology-and-innovation/waldo-jaquith)
[employees](http://waldo.jaquith.org/).

#### Private data
An interesting case is
[rseel](https://data.oregon.gov/profile/rseel/izyb-s78c?category=Recreation&utf8=%E2%9C%93&view_type=table).
He is the author behind a private table, and 
[Cam Caldwell](), a Socrata employee, made 
[this view](https://data.oregon.gov/Health-Human-Services/WIC-Authorized-Vendors/5ew8-h6d9?)
based on that table. So some of the situations where people have tables but no views might
occur because of private views.

### `roleName`
You may have noticed that most of the people in the above tables have
`roleName` fields. I think that people tend to have a `roleName` field
if and only if they work for data publishers. To make that more clear,
here's a table.

```{r data.publishers}
users$has.role <- !is.na(users$roleName)
```

```{r roleName.for.govt}
table(users$n_tables > users$n_views, users$has.role)
```

Here's a plot.

```{r roleName.plot}
users$more.tables <- users$n_tables > users$n_views
users.roleNames <- ddply(users, 'more.tables', function(df) {
  out <- data.frame(
    has.role = c(T,F),
    prop = c(
      mean(df$has.role),
      1 - mean(df$has.role)
    )
  )
})
barplot(users.roleNames$prop[users.roleNames$more.tables],
  names.arg = c('Has a roleName', 'No roleName'),
  ylim = 0:1, border = NA, las = 1,
  ylab = 'Proportion of users with more tables than views',
  xlab = 'User group', main = 'Are roleNames for data publisher employees?'
)
```

And if we want to get all statistical about it, we can run
Fisher's Exact test on that table.

```{r fisher.test}
fisher.test(table(users$n_tables > users$n_views, users$has.role))
```

and find that these counts are indeed disproportionate. 

This is all to say that **`roleName` appears to be a decent proxy for "data publisher"**.

### `flags`
In a similar vein, I looked at Socrata users with a `flags` field.

```{r socrata.employees}
users$has.flag <- !is.na(users$flags)
subset(users, has.flag)['displayName']
```

These appear to all be Socrata employees.

Hmm. Does anyone have both a `roleName` and a flag?

```{r rolename.and.flag}
subset(users, has.flag & has.role)[c('displayName', 'roleName')]
```

[Beth](http://www.socrata.com/newsroom-article/government-innovator-beth-blauer-joins-socrata/)
and [Bryant](www.linkedin.com/in/bryantlau) are both
Socrata employees. I don't know why they have `roleName` fields.

Anyway, it looks like the **`flags` field is a decent proxy for "Socrata employee"**.

### Heavy users who work neither for government nor Socrata
If having a `flags` field means you work for Socrata and
having a `roleName` means you work for a data publisher (a government, usually),
then people with neither `flags` nor a `roleName` are the
citizens that Socrata is trying to empower.

```{r citizens}
citizens <- subset(users, !has.flag & !has.role)
columns <- c('displayName', 'n_tables', 'n_views')
head(citizens[order(citizens$n_views, decreasing = T),columns])
```

Hmm okay they're not all citizens. For example,
"[Public Datasets](https://opendata.socrata.com/profile/Public-Datasets/vc35-nh3p)"
appears to be [recovery.gov](http://www.recovery.gov)'s open data initiative,
which is running on [opendata.socrata.com](https://opendata.socrata.com)
rather than on a separate portal.

Maybe we should also expect citizens not to have uploaded any tables.

```{r citizens.2}
citizens <- subset(users, !has.flag & !has.role & n_tables == 0)
head(citizens[order(citizens$n_views, decreasing = T),columns])
```

Now we're getting somewhere.

[Njbate](https://explore.data.gov/profile/Njbate/jyr3-c2kp?)
made a bunch of filtered views on the
[FEC Contributions dataset](https://explore.data.gov/Contributors/FEC-Contributions/4dkz-64bn).

[CPHA](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/profile/CPHA/cif6-aywu?)
made a bunch of filtered views on the
[Baltimore 311 request dataset](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Community/311-Customer-Service-Requests/9agw-sxsr).

The [Kenya Open Data Bot](https://opendata.go.ke/profile/Kenya-Open-Data-Bot/teh5-ns3w?)
made a bunch of charts on a few different datasets.
These charts are quite popular, and they account for a quarter of Kenya's open data portal.

Anyway, I see a pattern here: Users with the most views
just made different filters on the same dataset.

Let's try this yet again, but this time, let's look only at people with profile images.

```{r citizens.3}
citizens <- subset(users, !has.flag & !has.role & n_tables == 0 & !is.na(profileImageUrlLarge))
columns <- c('displayName', 'n_tables', 'n_views', 'profileImageUrlLarge')
head(citizens[order(citizens$n_views, decreasing = T),columns], 10)
```

I ran queries like this to find what portals and data they used.

    subset(socrata, owner.id == 'aeze-ppu4')[c('portal', 'id', 'tableId', 'name', 'viewCount')]
    table(subset(socrata, owner.id == 'aeze-ppu4')$portal)

They look more like real people doing real analysis.

#### not The White House
![not The White House](images/not The White House.jpg)

[not The White House](https://explore.data.gov/profile/not-The-White-House/732w-crxq)
is "[w]ay more open and transparent than the official White House website."
It's another account that's just making filters on one dataset, but they're a bit more
creative, diverse and involved. Here are some of her popular views.

* [People who went on the West Wing tour](https://explore.data.gov/dataset/West-Wing-Tour/e8wt-55cb)
* [People who played basketball at the White House](https://explore.data.gov/dataset/People-who-played-basketball-at-the-White-House/a4h3-3v3x)
* [Secret Service BBQ](https://explore.data.gov/dataset/Secret-Service-BBQ/tgmj-eaig)

not The White House also has its own separate website, 
[whitehouse.gov1.info](http://whitehouse.gov1.info/),
which is a parody of the [official White House website](http://www.whitehouse.gov/).

#### NL
![Picture of NL](<%= @item.identifier %>NL.jpg)

[NL](https://finances.worldbank.org/profile/NL/aeze-ppu4)
used to do a lot with World Bank data, though she hasn't for a few months.

She also has some views
[on databox.worldbank.org](https://databox.worldbank.org/profile/NL/aeze-ppu4).
Interestingly, that portal didn't show up in my list of Socrata portals.


#### VinylFox
![Picture of VinylFox](<%= @item.identifier %>VinylFox.jpg)

[VinylFox](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/profile/VinylFox/86yi-jydw?)
has also made a bunch of interesting filters on Baltimore data.
His website discusses this [a bit more](http://www.vinylfox.com/about/).
<!-- Talk to him. -->

#### Dave Francis Rodrigues
![Picture of Dave Francis Rodrigues](<%= @item.identifier %>Dave Francis Rodrigues.jpg)

[Dave](https://finances.worldbank.org/profile/Dave-Francis-Rodrigues/ef7y-9vvy?)
has made a lot of filters and charts about India.
He also names his views really well. In particular, I like his hack of prefixing
all of the titles with "Dave_"; this gets around how Socrata doesn't make it particularly
clear who created the view that you are looking at.

### People mostly use one portal.
When you make an account on any Socrata portal, you can use it to log in to
any of the other portals. Although this makes it easier for people to use
different portals, people don't seem to be doing that; people seem to stick
to just one portal.

(As I mentioned [previously](),
I think that all of the different Socrata portals are served from the
same web application and that this is why you can use the same credentials.)

<!-- discussion -->
Part of the issue might be that it is difficult to search across portals.

### Everyone else
I looked at a few specific Socrata users who are doing interesting things,
but let's look a bit more broadly. The histogram below shows how many views
users have created. Here, I'm including people without profile pictures.

```{r citizen.views.1}
citizens <- subset(users, !has.flag & !has.role & n_tables == 0)
hist(citizens$n_views,
  col = 1, border = NA,
  xlab = 'Number of Socrata views created by the user',
  ylab = 'Number of users', main = 'How many views do Socrata users make?'
)
```

Here it is again, but leaving out the top ten users to make it easier to see.

```{r citizen.views.2}
citizens <- subset(users, !has.flag & !has.role & n_tables == 0)
hist(citizens$n_views[citizens$n_views < 30],
  col = 1, border = NA,
  xlab = 'Number of Socrata views created by the user',
  ylab = 'Number of users', main = 'How many views do Socrata users make?'
)
```

As you might expect, most people make only one view.
In fact, there are probably even more users with no views.

```{r one.view}
table(citizens$n_views == 1)
```

In total, that's ``sum(citizens$n_views)``. That seems like a decent amount.
Cool.

### More about views
I remembered that I had the whole views dataset as well, so I connected the user
data back to that. In the following plot, each dot is a view. The location along
the Y axis indicates the user that created it, the location along the X axis
indicates the date of publication.

```{r user.views.1}
user.views <- sqldf('
SELECT
  users.id AS userid,
  socrata.id as viewid,
  nrow, ncol,
  viewType,
  createdAt,
  publicationDate
FROM socrata
LEFT JOIN users
ON socrata.owner_id = users.id
GROUP BY socrata.id')
user.views$date <- user.views$createdAt
user.views[is.na(user.views$date),'date'] <- user.views[is.na(user.views$createdAt),'publicationDate']

p <- ggplot(user.views) + aes(x = date, y = userid) + geom_point(alpha = 1/10) +
  theme(axis.text.y=element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_text('User creating the view'), axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_date('View publication date')
p
```

Let's add some more variables. In this next one, color is the type of view
and size is the number of cells.

```{r user.views.2}
p + aes(color = viewType, size = nrow * ncol) + scale_size_continuous('Number of cells', labels = comma)
```

The horizontal lines are users who have consistently created views for a while.
The vertical bands are situations when lots of different users created views all
around the same date.

Analyze all the datasets
=====
<% root = 'https://github.com/tlevine/socrata-analysis/tree/master/' %>

I downloaded the metadata files for most of the datasets across most of the Socrata data portals.
Here I explain how I did that and present an summary of the sorts of data that we find in the portals.

## Acquiring the data

## Initial analysis

```{r shape}
ggplot(socrata) + aes(x = ncol, y = nrow, size = downloadCount, color = portal) + geom_point()
```


Popular datasets by portal

  socrata[order(socrata$downloadCount, decreasing = T),][1:10,c('portal','id','nrow','ncol','downloadCount')]

## Future plans
I'm conducting more detailed studies around more pointed data portal considerations;
expect those to come out over the next few months. And I could use your help. If you
use or publish open data, I'd love to talk and see what you would like to know about
how open data get used; there's probably a lot we can learn from this dataset.

It covers state trends in S&T education, the employed workforce, finance, and research and development.  The tool allows for in-depth exploration of a single indicator, comparisons of multiple indicators, and the ability to customize the graphics.  Exploring a single indicator can be done using Tables, Chart or Map view.  Comparisons of indicators can be done across states or across years.  The tool contains up to 20 years of data when data are available and comparable."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 144, "name": "Science and Engineering Indicators: 2012 State Data Tool", "nrow": 0, "id": "tzdg-9v2v", "portal": "data.oregon.gov", "downloadCount": 287, "ncol": 0, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1333647447, "description": "The State Data Tool draws from the National Science Board's (NSB's)  Science and Engineering Indicators report.

These services make extensive use of the NHD and referenced program data in the RAD, and also integrate other WATERS program data. Designed as loosely coupled modular units, the services are developed in a common architecture. The Upstream/Downstream service is designed to provide standard stream network traversal and discovery functions. The traversal request may include a description of where, on the stream network, to begin the traversal, a description of where or how to end the traversal, and a list of one or more formats for the returned results. The Upstream/Downstream service receives the stream network traversal request, performs the traversal, and returns the requested results. The Upstream/Downstream service is an elemental function to be used by applications as a stand alone service or in combination with other WATERS (Watershed Assessment, Tracking & Environmental ResultS) services. All Upstream/Downstream executions require a navigation type and at least one start point. All other input parameters are optional."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 104, "name": "EPA Water Services - Upstream/Downstream Service", "nrow": 0, "id": "8esu-d5ih", "portal": "data.oregon.gov", "downloadCount": 65, "ncol": 0, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1348258376, "description": "The WATERS Web and Database services provide open interfaces to complex analyses.

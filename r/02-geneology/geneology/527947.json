It contains several layers reflecting the methods of reporting coverage required by the NTIA. The NTIA requires census block less than 2 sq. mi. to have information about the service available in the block, including service provider, speed and technology platform. In block larger than 2 sq. mi. broadband service is shown on roads within that block. The data set also includes \"Community Anchor Institutions\" (CAIs) and their broadband service. The data is compiled by asking broadband service providers about their service. In addition, the CAIs provide their service information to OIT directly."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 15, "name": "CO SBDD 20121001 - Datagov", "nrow": 0, "id": "2h8k-x9y5", "portal": "data.colorado.gov", "downloadCount": 11, "ncol": 0, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1354233576, "description": "This data set represents broadband coverage across the state of Colorado.

NDBC designs, develops, operates, and maintains a network of data collecting buoys and coastal stations. NDBC's virtual tour will give you an overview of what NDBC does, the facilities, the atmospheric and oceanographic variables measured, and the use of these data. NWS forecasters need frequent, high-quality marine observations to examine conditions for forecast preparation and to verify their forecasts after they are produced. Other users rely on the observations and forecasts for commercial and recreational activities. NDBC provides regular observations from a network of about 110 buoys and 60 Coastal Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) stations, and 55 Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) stations, to help meet these needs. All stations measure wind speed, direction, and gust; barometric pressure; and air temperature. In addition, all buoy stations, and some C-MAN stations, measure sea surface temperature and wave height and period. Conductivity and water current are measured at selected stations. NDBC also operates an array of 39 DART (Tsunami) stations.  In addition NDBC provides information from Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) partner stations, oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, and National Ocean Service (NOS) stations."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 457, "name": "National Data Buoy Center", "nrow": 0, "id": "akp5-3yz5", "portal": "data.oregon.gov", "downloadCount": 134, "ncol": 0, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1317992261, "description": "National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) is a part of the National Weather Service (NWS).

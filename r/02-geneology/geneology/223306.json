The three species are Bidens micrantha ssp. kalealaha, Portulaca sclerocarpa, and Tetramolopium remyi. A total of approximately 320 hectares (789 acres) of land on Lanai fall within the boundaries of the six critical habitat units designated for the three species. Purpose: Critical habitat are areas considered essential for the conservation of a listed species. These areas provide notice to the public and land managers the importance of these areas to the conservation of this species. Special protections and/or restrictions are possible in areas where federal funding, permits, licenses, authorizations, or actions occur or are required."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 469, "name": "Final Critical Habitat for 3 Plant Species From the Island of Lanai, HI", "nrow": 0, "id": "6eum-kjyi", "portal": "data.oregon.gov", "downloadCount": 431, "ncol": 0, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1298048195, "description": "Abstract: These data identify, in general, the areas where final critical habitat occurs for 99 listed plant species known historically from the island of Lanai.

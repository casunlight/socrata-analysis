Through the Section 8 Rental Voucher Program, the administering housing authority issues a voucher to an income-qualified household, which then finds a unit to rent. If the unit meets the Section 8 quality standards, the PHA then pays the landlord the amount equal to the difference between 30 percent of the tenant's adjusted income (or 10 percent of the gross income or the portion of welfare assistance designated for housing) and the PHA-determined payment standard for the area. The rent must be reasonable compared with similar unassisted units."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 3703, "name": "Public Housing Agency (PHA) Inventory", "nrow": 0, "id": "3n2v-xk7d", "portal": "data.oregon.gov", "downloadCount": 2781, "ncol": 0, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1298048119, "description": "The dataset  contains current data on low rent and Section 8 units in PHA's administered by HUD.

The 2009 edition of the Digest of Education Statistics is the 45th in a series of publications initiated in 1962. The Digest has been issued annually except for combined editions for the years 1977-78, 1983-84, and 1985-86. Its primary purpose is to provide a compilation of statistical information covering the broad field of American education from prekindergarten through graduate school. The Digest includes a selection of data from many sources, both government and private, and draws especially on the results of surveys and activities carried out by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). To qualify for inclusion in the Digest, material must be nationwide in scope and of current interest and value. The publication contains information on a variety of subjects in the field of education statistics, including the number of schools and colleges, teachers, enrollments, and graduates, in addition to data on educational attainment, finances, federal funds for education, libraries, and international comparisons. Supplemental information on population trends, attitudes on education, education characteristics of the labor force, government finances, and economic trends provides background for evaluating education data. Although the Digest contains important information on federal education funding, more detailed information on federal activities is available from federal education program offices."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 1226, "name": "Digest of Education Statistics: 2009", "nrow": 0, "id": "db2r-de3f", "portal": "data.oregon.gov", "downloadCount": 826, "ncol": 0, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1298048395, "description": "This annual report provides a compilation of statistical information covering the broad field of education from prekindergarten through graduate school.

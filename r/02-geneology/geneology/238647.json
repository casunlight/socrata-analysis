The user can view, for example, data pertaining to the top annual and ozone season emitters of a selected pollutant, the number of units and facilities in a particular state, and trends in sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon dioxide emissions.  EPA's Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) includes several market-based regulatory programs designed to improve air quality and ecosystems. The most well-known of these programs are EPA's Acid Rain Program and the NOx Programs, which reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx)-compounds that adversely affect air quality, the environment, and public health. CAMD also plays an integral role in the development and implementation of the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR)."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 88, "name": "Clean Air Markets - Quick Facts and Trends", "nrow": 0, "id": "ts5d-4tu9", "portal": "data.oregon.gov", "downloadCount": 79, "ncol": 0, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1311252097, "description": "The Quick Facts and Trends module is part of a suite of Clean Air Markets-related tools that are accessible at http://camddataandmaps.epa.gov/gdm/index.cfm.

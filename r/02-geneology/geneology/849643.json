An R&D accomplishment is the outcome of past research whose benefits are being realized now. It may describe the results of decades of R&D or a one-time breakthrough by an individual researcher. The core of the site is the DOE R&D Accomplishments Database, consisting of searchable electronic documents, with bibliographic citations, that report accomplishments from the Department of Energy, DOE contractor facilities, and DOE predecessors: the Manhattan Project, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), and the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA). Complementing the database are Feature Topic pages, Laureates, Interesting Insights, and Snapshots. Featured Topic pages spotlight an individual scientist or an area of research. Laureate information includes names, date, and type (Nobel or Fermi).  Interesting insights provides a unique view of DOE and predecessor agency research and developments.  Snapshots provide quick pictures, introductions, overviews, or synopses of DOE accomplishments."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 64, "name": "DOE R&D Accomplishments", "nrow": 0, "id": "d7y8-zyi9", "portal": "data.oregon.gov", "downloadCount": 29, "ncol": 0, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1368216750, "description": "DOE R&D Accomplishments is a publicly-available central forum for information about the outcomes of past DOE-sponsored or generated research and development.

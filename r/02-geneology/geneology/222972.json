The information delivered by CIMS includes technical and public information, educational material, environmental indicators, policy documents, and scientific data.  Through the use of relational databases, web-based programming, and web-based GIS a large number of Internet resources have been established.  These resources include multiple distributed on-line databases, on-demand graphing and mapping of environmental data, and geographic searching tools for environmental information.  Baseline monitoring data, summarized data and environmental indicators that document ecosystem status and trends, confirm linkages between water quality, habitat quality and abundance, and the distribution and integrity of biological populations are also available.

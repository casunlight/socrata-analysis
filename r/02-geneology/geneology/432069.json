The Point Indexing service is a subset component of the Event Indexing Service providing a simplified point indexing function for linking a point to the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) via either a straightforward shortest distance snap or via raindrop indexing utilizing the NHDPlus flow direction grid. The service returns the point, information about the indexing action and NHD flowline information describing the nearest NHD hydrography."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 43, "name": "EPA Water Services - Point Indexing Service", "nrow": 0, "id": "jwxz-8k7f", "portal": "data.oregon.gov", "downloadCount": 30, "ncol": 0, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1348258371, "description": "The WATERS Web and Database services provide open interfaces to complex analyses.

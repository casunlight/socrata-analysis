Much of the data in LinKS and ASPIRE are simply not measured in other health systems - VA is raising the bar. When available, VA uses outside benchmarks but often sets VA standards or goals at a higher level. VA scores hospitals more than 30% different from the goal as underperforming or red and those only 10% different from the goal are shown in green in ASPIRE.

ASPIRE is not about finding fault but about helping VA to target opportunities for improving performance   ASPIRE is a dashboard that documents quality and safety goals for all VA Hospitals. This data shows strengths and opportunities for improvement at the national, regional and local hospital level. Aspire data supports the VA's mission of a continuous health care improvement program to provide the best possible care to Veterans. The database lists many \"measures\" and our goal for each measure. The data shows \"where we are\" in comparison to where we want to be. A simple example would be for blood pressure management. The goal for all veterans age 18-85 with high blood pressure is to have blood pressure readings less than 140/90. This measure shows the percentage of Veterans meeting that blood pressure goal. The data in this dashboard will be updated on a regular basis.   VA's Linking Information Knowledge and Systems (LinKS) is a dashboard that documents outcome measures for acute care, ICU, outpatient, safety and annual measures. This data shows strengths and opportunities for improvement at the national, regional and local hospital levels. LinKS supports the VA mission to provide the best possible care to the Veterans. The dashboard shows what we are measuring and our result. A simple example would be for smoking. We measure the percentage of veterans that smoke and what we've done to help them stop smoking such as smoking cessation classes, counseling or medication to help them quit. The data will be updated on a regular basis."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 1417, "name": "US Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration,  ASPIRE and LinKS", "nrow": 0, "id": "swhp-ybwu", "portal": "data.oregon.gov", "downloadCount": 580, "ncol": 0, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1298048878, "description": "The Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the VA's Under Secretary for Health are committed to transparency - giving Americans the facts.

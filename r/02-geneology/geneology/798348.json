Please be aware that from April 2011 through September 9, 2011, the NLRB implemented a new case management system (NxGen) that replaced CATS.  This was an ongoing process, and each month, from April through September, additional regions migrated to NxGen, with the data for those regions being retained solely in NxGen.

The NWLON is a network of 200+ long-term, continuously operating water-level stations throughout the USA, including its island possessions and territories and the Great Lakes. The NWLON has expanded over time in response to increasing national and local needs. NWLON stations are the foundation for reference stations for NOAA's tide prediction products, and serve as controls in determining tidal datums for all short-term water-level stations. NWLON has taken advantage of technological advancements in sensors, data collection and data communications which have enabled routine real-time automated and event-driven data acquisition using the GOES satellite. NWLON data-collection platforms are capable of measuring other oceanographic parameters in addition to water levels, including meteorological parameters. Because of these advancements, the application of NWLON data and products has broadened. For instance, the NWLON is a key part of the NOAA Tsunami Warning System and the NOAA Storm Surge Warning System. NWLON stations support Physical Oceanographic Real-Time Systems (PORTS) in major ports and harbors. NWLON stations have standard configurations of water level sensors (including backup sensors), backup and primary data-collection platforms, solar panel power, GOES satellite radios, and telephone modems. Sensors are calibrated and vertically referenced to nearby networks of benchmarks. The data continuity, the vertical stability and careful referencing of NWLON stations have enabled the data to be used to estimate relative sea-level trends for the Nation."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 179, "name": "The National Water Level Observation Network", "nrow": 0, "id": "ssfm-ee4x", "portal": "data.oregon.gov", "downloadCount": 156, "ncol": 0, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1318608302, "description": "The fundamental observational component of the National Water Level Program (NWLP) is the National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON).

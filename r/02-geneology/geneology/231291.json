This crawl operates continually and will be retrieving both already-submitted documents and new documents as the USPTO makes them publicly available.  Except for repackaging into zip files, these documents are hosted by Google unchanged. A single zip file is created for each patent application. There is detailed documentation about the format as well as the overview below.  How to access PAIR data To access a particular zipfile, replace \"APP_NUM\" in the following URL with an application number of interest:  http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/uspto-pair/applications/APP_NUM.zip    For example: http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/uspto-pair/applications/12102391.zip                                                                                                  Over 550,000 applications are available. Additional applications will be added regularly as the crawl progresses.   Overview of zipfile contents Each zipfile contains the following:  - A README.txt file which indicates when the data was obtained. - Data files (*.tsv), in tab-delimited text format, compatible with many spreadsheet programs. Each data file represents one tab from the PAIR interface: Address and Attorney/Agent, Application Data, Continuity Data, Foreign Priority, Image File Wrapper, Patent Term Adjustments / Extension History, Transaction History.  - Data tables from the PAIR interface are organized in one of two ways:  1.Labels in the first column. (Example: \"Application Data\" tab.) The second column contains the corresponding value (example: \"Application number\" and \"12/102,391\"). 2.Labels in the first row. (Example: \"Transaction History\" tab, with labels such as \"Date\" and \"Transaction Description\".) Each subsequent row contains the corresponding values for one data item. (In the example, each row represents a single transaction.) - Some *.tsv files contain more than one table, separated by a blank line.  - The \"Image File Wrapper\" data file is put in a separate directory along with the additional content that it links to. An extra \"Filename\" column is added to the *.tsv file to indicate the appropriate file for each item. - Image files (*.pdf), in Adobe PDF format. This data is only available for patent applications which have an \"Image File Wrapper\" tab on the USPTO PAIR site.  Disclaimer No guarantees are made with respect to the completeness or accuracy of this data. In particular, the crawl may discover and retrieve additional documents over time, even for applications submitted long ago. Please visit the USPTO PAIR site for official, current, and complete information.  Available applications As of 2011-03-01, we have data for 557,496 patent applications, including most of the published applications in the following ranges:  08000001 - 08033366 08100000 - 08134568 08200000 - 08235165 09800000 - 09829887 09900000 - 09930278 10000001 - 10024198 10100000 - 10126373 10200000 - 10221198 10300001 - 10320839 10400000 - 10416691 10500000 - 10522314 10600001 - 10618797 10700000 - 10719621 10800001 - 10815533 10900000 - 10920020 11000001 - 11048436 11100000 - 11115288 11200000 - 11214805 11300000 - 11316288 11400000 - 11415735 11500000 - 11515038 11600000 - 11615977 11700000 - 11716134 11800000 - 11814900 11900000 - 11914299 12000001 - 12016975 12100001 - 12118438 12200000 - 12219134 12300000 - 12320004 12400000 - 12425351 12500000 - 12518850 12600000 - 12620771 29000001 - 29026192 60000003 - 60001535 90000001 - 90006696 95000001 - 95001409"}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 1165, "name": "Public PAIR (Patent Application Information Retrieval) Bulk Data (2001 - Present)", "nrow": 0, "id": "bz4p-ppqp", "portal": "data.oregon.gov", "downloadCount": 1322, "ncol": 0, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1304468250, "description": "Google has begun crawling patent documents, including Image File Wrappers, from the USPTO's Public PAIR (Patent Application Information Retrieval) site.

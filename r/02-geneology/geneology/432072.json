These services make extensive use of the NHD and referenced program data in the RAD, and also integrate other WATERS program data.

The Spatial Assignment Service is a support service allowing users to associate spatial information with reference layers stored in WATERS (Watershed Assessment, Tracking & Environmental ResultS). The intention of the service is not to report or analyze all interactions with the reference layer but rather to assign a single result.  Provided parameters allow several means to resolve multiple matches including hinting via parameters, spatial analysis, distance analysis or simple arbitrary choice."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 41, "name": "EPA Water Services - Spatial Assignment Service", "nrow": 0, "id": "nfgt-gdp4", "portal": "data.oregon.gov", "downloadCount": 14, "ncol": 0, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1348258373, "description": "The WATERS Web and Database services provide open interfaces to complex analyses.

In 2009-10 institutions had the choice of using the old race/ethnicity categories or the new new race/ethnicity categories or a mix of old and new to report completions data. Each record will contain both old and new categories and a set of derived variables that combine both old and new. The set of race/ethnicity variables that will be used in IPEDS publications during these optional reporting years will be the derived set of variables, the two or more race category from the new reporting method, race/ethnicity unknown and Nonresident Aliens.

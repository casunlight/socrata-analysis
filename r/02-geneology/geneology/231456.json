Select data fields for each case record are extracted from foreign labor certification application tables within OFLC case management systems based on the most recent date a determination decision was issued. Each data set is cumulative, containing unique records identified by the applicable OFLC case number, and any noticeable typographical or other data anomalies may be due to internal data entry or other external customer errors in completing the application form.   Important Notice: Employer-specific case information that appears on FLCDataCenter.com was provided to ETA by employers who submitted foreign labor certification applications.

The BLS-OES program provides estimates used to assist in setting the wage levels in the FLC wage library.

The District of Columbia\u2019s Office of Contracting and Procurement (OCP) and Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) launched the execution of a new information technology (IT) staff augmentation contract that promises to transform the District\u2019s IT staff augmentation (ITSA) process. The new contract will inaugurate an innovative method of procuring IT contract staff resources and save the District millions of dollars annually on technology spending. OCP and OCTO developed the new ITSA structure after a six-month study of IT staff procurement in the District and other states. The study found the District\u2019s process too costly and time consuming, and found 80 percent of vendors were dissatisfied based on lack of transparency, lack of opportunity, and slow payment. The study also found that at least 18 other states have solved similar problems through a new structure in which one or more prime contractors provide capped rates for IT staff positions and subcontract with other vendors to fill them. This best-practice structure formed the basis for the District\u2019s ITSA Request for Proposal (RFP). The new contract requires that 95 percent of the total spend go to District Certified Business Enterprises (CBEs). The new process also widens opportunity and transparency for all businesses by enabling all vendors to see all IT staff procurement opportunities--online and in real time--including, the winning bidder, the rates, and the program manager who selected the bidder."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 553, "name": "ITSA Awarded Engagements", "nrow": 185, "id": "36ir-y874", "portal": "opendata.socrata.com", "downloadCount": 412, "ncol": 21, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1242939874, "description": "Provides information about ITSA Awarded Engagements.

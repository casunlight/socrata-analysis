It was implemented to improve the availability of data needed for improving vehicle safety performance and reducing deaths related to vehicles in transport. The Agency's goal is to reduce fatal injuries resulting from motor vehicle crashes to a rate of 1.0 fatalities per 100M VMT from the current rate of 1.5. It is the only national census data system for fatal vehicle crashes. FARS is extensively referenced to support legislation, enforcement and education programs designed to reduce injury and property damage resulting from motor vehicle crashes. The FARS data are used by virtually all traffic safety professionals and other customers interested in traffic safety including: Congress, NHTSA, USDOT, State agencies, the automotive industry, the insurance industry, advocacy groups, international users, and the general public. The FARS data support customers' most significant programs that address traffic safety. It is the basis for the Agency's traffic safety grants to the States for programs such as the Impaired Driver Program. FARS collects State level data for analysis of traffic safety crashes to identify problems and evaluate countermeasures designed to reduce injuries and property damage resulting from motor vehicle crashes. The data are used for agency rulemaking and targeting grant money to areas most in need. The types of data collected can be used specifically to conduct research on ways to remediate problems such as alcohol involvement, vehicle types, weather and road conditions, seat belt use, car seats, air bags. The program provides analytical data and information to the public through various media, including the program's web services. The program is able to target data collections to respond to the most recent Congressional interest and mandates for new data. The Information Technology component provides for support for operations and maintenance of the program's data collection application, client server platform, and communications network that is consistent with the Agency's architecture and standards. Without the FARS program and data, many of the legislative actions, enforcement, and education programs designed to save lives and reduce traffic safety related injuries and property damage could not be targeted, affected, or enacted."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 2496, "name": "Fatalities Analysis Report System", "nrow": 0, "id": "gjf3-c985", "portal": "data.oregon.gov", "downloadCount": 1594, "ncol": 0, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1298047913, "description": "FARS is a steady state crash data collection and analysis program.

The RadNet network, which has stations in each state, has been used to track environmental releases of radioactivity from nuclear weapons tests and nuclear accidents.  In general, data generated from RadNet provide the information base for making decisions necessary to ensure the protection of public health. The system helps EPA determine whether additional sampling or other actions are needed in response to particular releases of radioactivity to the environment. RadNet can also provide supplementary information on population exposure, radiation trends, and other aspects of releases.  The RadNet map interface provides access to near-real-time data (updated approximately hourly) on atmospheric radiation in monitoring locations."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 6209, "name": "RadNet Map Interface for Near-Real-Time Radiation Monitoring Data", "nrow": 0, "id": "8c68-pzbm", "portal": "data.oregon.gov", "downloadCount": 2841, "ncol": 0, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1304468274, "description": "RadNet is a national network of monitoring stations that regularly collect air, precipitation, drinking water, and milk samples for analysis of radioactivity.

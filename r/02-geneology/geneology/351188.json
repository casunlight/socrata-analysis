(Copyright 2011. The Trust for Public Land. All Rights Reserved) In 2011, The Trust for Public Land (TPL) partnered with Great Outdoors Colorado (GOCO) to examine conservation priorities for children's access to green spaces, protecting riparian habitats, and enhancing regional trail connectivity across the 8-county Denver Metropolitan region. The study area for this project includes all or portions of the following counties: Adams, Arapahoe, Jefferson, Denver, Douglas, Weld, Broomfield, and Boulder. Study area boundaries were defined to encompass the Denver Regional 2035 Urban Growth boundary, using the MPO boundary to the east and the mountain backdrop to the west. A fundamental milestone for this project was to create an up-to-date inventory of publicly accessible parks, green space, and trails.

Each record displays the standardized form of the organization's name, the organization's parent and suborganizations, and the organization's Source Code.  A Source Code is a unique numeric designation assigned by DTIC to each organization in the database. The purpose of the database is to find the Source Code for an organization.  The Source Code can then be searched in the Technical Reports, Research Summaries, or IR&D databases to find all the reports from an organization, despite variations in its name.  Searching by Source Code Hierarchy enables you to find all reports from an organization plus reports from its suborganizations and reports submitted under previous names."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 779, "name": "DTIC Corporate Source Authority System", "nrow": 0, "id": "gxnj-ikvv", "portal": "data.oregon.gov", "downloadCount": 719, "ncol": 0, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1298048829, "description": "The Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) maintains a Corporate Source Authority System (CSAS) which lists all organizations that have contributed information to any of DTIC's three major databases.

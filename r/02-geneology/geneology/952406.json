The extensive surveys developed topographic imagery to study Folsom Dam, the wing and auxiliary dams, and the eight dikes that form Folsom Lake. The underwater survey was conducted from September 9 through 22, 2005 between lake elevations 437 and 441 feet (project datum). The underwater survey used sonic depth recording equipment interfaced with a global positioning system (GPS) that gave continuous sounding positions throughout the underwater portions of the reservoir covered by the survey vessel. The above-water topography was developed by aerial photography under contract with Reclamation. The main body of the reservoir was flown on October 20, 2005 near reservoir elevation 430.2 (NAVD88-05) and high accuracy data was flown on 10/31/2005 near reservoir elevation 427.1 (NAVD88-05). The 2005 topographic maps were developed from the combined data sets. All digital topographic images for these studies were tied to vertical datum NAVD88-05. For purpose of computing updated area and capacity tables, the topographic elevations were shifted 2.34 feet to match the project vertical elevations. The bathymetric survey measured a minimum elevation of 190. Lake contour surface areas were developed from elevation 490.0 and below.As of September 2005, at water surface elevation 466.0, the surface area was 11,140 acres with a total capacity of 966,823 acre-feet.

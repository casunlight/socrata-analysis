Roosevelt Reservoir (Lake Roosevelt) began in October 2010 and continued duringportions of June, July, and August of 2011. The primary purpose was to develop detailed digital reservoir topography. Theunderwater survey was conducted between water surface elevation 1,260 and spilling elevation 1,290 (project datum in feet).This study measured the project vertical datum around 2.5 feet lower than the North American Vertical Datum of 1988(NAVD88). The generated reservoir topography elevations were tied to NAVD88. The surface area and volume computationsfrom the topography were shifted -2.5 feet to match the Grand Coulee project's vertical datum. The underwater survey usedsonic depth recording equipment interfaced with real-time global positioning systems that provided continuous soundingpositions throughout the underwater portion of the reservoir covered by the survey vessels. The 2010-11 reservoir topographywas generated by importing digital coverages from 1974 aerial photogrammetry, 2007 bathymetry of the upper reservoir, and2009-10 Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveys combined with the 2010-11 bathymetric data. The 2010-11 bathymetricdata was the first detailed bottom information of the deeper portions of Lake Roosevelt, below elevation 1,160.As of August 2011, at reservoir water surface elevation 1,290.0, the surface area was 81,991 acres with a total capacity of9,715,346 acre-feet and an active capacity, between elevation 1,208.0 and 1,290.0, of 5,349,560 acre-feet."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 88, "name": "2010-2011 Hydrologic Survey of Franklin D.

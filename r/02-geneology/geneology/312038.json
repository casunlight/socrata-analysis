The GLSEA is stored as a 1024x1024 pixel map in PNG or ASCII format, suitable for viewing on PCs and workstations with readily available software. The lake surface temperatures are derived from NOAA polar-orbiting satellite imagery obtained through the Great Lakes CoastWatch program. The addition of ice cover information was implemented in early 1999, using data provided by the National Ice Center (NIC). Lake surface temperatures are updated daily with information from the cloud-free portions of the previous day's satellite imagery. If no imagery is available, a smoothing algorithm is applied to the previous day's map. Ice information will then be added, using the most recent Great Lakes Ice Analysis produced by NIC, currently daily during the ice season. GLERL is currently receiving a product suite of an average of 108 enhanced digital images including satellite-derived surface temperature (Fig. 1.1), visible and near-infrared reflectance, brightness temperatures, cloud masks, and satellite/solar zenith angle data from the NOAA/AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer)."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 71, "name": "Great Lakes Surface Environmental Analysis", "nrow": 0, "id": "92sc-p8u9", "portal": "data.oregon.gov", "downloadCount": 102, "ncol": 0, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1333647443, "description": "The Great Lakes Surface Environmental Analysis (GLSEA2) is a digital map of the Great Lakes surface water temperature and ice cover which is produced daily at the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) in Ann Arbor, Michigan through the NOAA CoastWatch program.

The underwater survey conducted between water surface elevations 1,559.2 and 1,559.5 (feet), used sonic depth recording equipment interfaced with a real-time kinematic (RTK) global positioning system (GPS) that provided continuous sounding positions throughout the underwater portion of the reservoir covered by the survey vessel.  The above-water topography was obtained by digitizing reservoir contour lines from the U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle (USGS quad) maps of the reservoir area and adjusting them with the limited RTK GPS land survey points collected in November 2006 and February 2008.  The RTK GPS and USGS quad contour data were also used to develop contours where boat access was not possible due to thick vegetation and shallow water conditions.  This study assumed no change since the 1967 survey at 1,565 and above.  The surface areas and resulting capacity data from elevation 1,559 to 1,565 were computed by linear interpolation.  Accurate mapping of the upper reservoir contours would require aerial data collection when the vegetation foliage was minimal and during low reservoir conditions."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 99, "name": "2007 Hydrologic and Sedimentation Survey of Altus Reservoir", "nrow": 0, "id": "mp2y-6e8y", "portal": "data.oregon.gov", "downloadCount": 24, "ncol": 0, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1363894333, "description": "Reclamation surveyed Altus Reservoir in November 2006, June 2007, and February 2008 to develop updated reservoir topography and compute the present storage-elevation relationship (area -capacity tables).

The Multipurpose Marine Cadastre (MMC) data viewer is an integrated marine information system that provides legal, physical, ecological, and cultural information in a common geographic information system (GIS) framework. In particular, the MMC would be beneficial to those involved in coastal and marine spatial planning efforts that involve finding the best location for renewable energy projects. Users pick the ocean geography of their choosing and quickly see the applicable jurisdictional boundaries, restricted areas, laws, critical habitat locations, and other important features. With the MMC, potential conflicts can be identified and avoided early in the planning process. The MMC is also a helpful tool in the permit review process. All organizations considering an offshore activity can benefit from this comprehensive, visual approach to data analysis."}, "datasets": [{"viewCount": 398, "name": "Marine Cadastre National Viewer", "nrow": 0, "id": "utht-ehhp", "portal": "data.oregon.gov", "downloadCount": 339, "ncol": 0, "modifyingViewUid": null, "createdAt": 1298048350, "description": "The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) and the DOI Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEM), in cooperation with federal and state partners, have created a GIS-based marine information system for U.S. waters.

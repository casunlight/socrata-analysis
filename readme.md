Socrata Analysis
======
I [downloaded](https://github.com/tlevine/socrata-download) the metadata files
for all of the Socrata datasets on all of the Socrata portals as of
approximately June 23, 2013. Let's do something fun with them.

I don't like to distinguish between metadata and data, and I think this analysis
embodies that mindset. Anything can be turned into data, and data can be turned
into anything. You can use metadata to annotate graphs and stuff, but you can
also make graphs and models of the metadata.

Themes that are coming out
--------
There's a lot of awesome stuff going on in Socrata,
but I had no idea about it until I started looking
into it this deeply.

I'l always seen Socrata as this clumsy, unnecessarily
engineered website for serving files and searching
for them. And I figured it had import APIs, but that's
not special.

The special thing, I'm now learning, is that ordinary
people can make graphs and maps of the data. I live in
this bubble of people who know how to use computers.
A random person is unlikely to know even how to make
a bar graph. And if she does, she'll only know how to
do it in Excel, and she might not even know how to
export it as a PDF.

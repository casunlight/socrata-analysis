Socrata Analysis
======
I [downloaded](https://github.com/tlevine/socrata-download) the metadata files
for all of the Socrata datasets on all of the Socrata portals as of
approximately June 23, 2013. Let's do something fun with them.

I don't like to distinguish between metadata and data, and I think this analysis
embodies that mindset. Anything can be turned into data, and data can be turned
into anything. You can use metadata to annotate graphs and stuff, but you can
also make graphs and models of the metadata.

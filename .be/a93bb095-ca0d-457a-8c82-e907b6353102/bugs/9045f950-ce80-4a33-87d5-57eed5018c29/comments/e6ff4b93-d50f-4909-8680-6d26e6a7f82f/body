Nicole's thoughts again

* People liked that Socrata has a lot of technical support

When choosing the portal, Oakland looked at just Socrata, CKAN
and Junar. (There aren't really many people in this market.)

* Junar seemed too basic and unable to handle larger data and
    more datasets, and they didn't have an API to sync datasets
    from internal datasets.
* CKAN needed either internal support or a separate contracted support.

Nicole can send me that analysis

Also from Nicole:

CKAN has bugs. Like mapping never works right.

Socrata's mapping and visualization tools work really well.

* "Any city staff person can generate a map of location-based data on the fly."
* Someone embedded a pie chart of the wildlife prevention thing. If they didn't
    have Socrata, they probably would have put together a pdf report. There are
    other tools for this, but the people working for the city don't know them.
* This older couple that sometimes comes to OpenOakland uses Socrata to do things
    like filter the crime data for their neighborhood and then present it at
    some community meeting.

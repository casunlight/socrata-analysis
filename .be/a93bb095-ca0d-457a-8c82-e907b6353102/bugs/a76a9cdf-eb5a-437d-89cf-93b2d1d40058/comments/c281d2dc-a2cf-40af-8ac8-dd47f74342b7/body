People in open data apparently like to talk
a lot about data standards. (I've apparently
been good at avoiding these discussions, so
I'd actually like to hear more about them.)

Along those lines, I think it would be cool to
find the same sort of data from similar
municipalities (like animals in the zoo for
different cities) and compare the schemas.
Even better, infer a mapping between the schemas!

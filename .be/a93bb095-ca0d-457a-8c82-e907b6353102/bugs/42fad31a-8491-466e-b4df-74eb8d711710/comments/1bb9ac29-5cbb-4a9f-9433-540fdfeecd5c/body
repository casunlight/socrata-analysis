Spike suggested that this is why people are
interested in the open data stuff:

People haven't been doing open data for very
long, so they don't know what comes out of it.
People would probably like to see what happens
when you release data.

Part of this is direction as to how to release
open data and what to release, but it's more
about giving people a reason to do open data
at all. Don't just stop at what data are released
and which ones get viewed; see what comes of
the data way down the line.
